## 🤔 What Should You Do Next?

Here are your options with honest pros/cons:

### Option 1: Continue Android Implementation Step-by-Step

**What this means:**

- ✅ No additional resources needed

**Cons:**
- ❌ Very time-consuming (weeks of back-and-forth)

- ❌ Slower than professional development
- ❌ Still requires Android Studio and testing

**Recommendation:** ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Not the most efficient approach

---

### Option 2: Use the Implementation Guide with Developers

### Option 4: Move to Other Phases

**What this means:**
